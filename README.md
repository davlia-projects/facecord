# facecord v0.1.0
You can invite my hosted bot here
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=430269660173434882&permissions=8&scope=bot

This will clear out your guild upon invite and reformat it, so *only invite it to a new server*. 

## Running the bot yourself

```
export BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
export BOT_TOKEN_DEV=<your_developer_bot_token>
```

To get a bot token, go to the developer panel for Discord and create a Bot.


To run it, just run `make`.

## Currently in development
 - More commands for the admin channel
